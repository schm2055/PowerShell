1. Check for accounts that don't have password expiry set

Get-ADUser -Filter 'useraccountcontrol -band 65536' -Properties useraccountcontrol | export-csv U-DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD.csv
"Non expiring passwords are bad. Especially if it's a regular unexpected user, might be IOC [indicator of compromise] then."

2. Check for accounts that have no password requirement
Get-ADUser -Filter 'useraccountcontrol -band 32' -Properties useraccountcontrol | export-csv U-PASSWD_NOTREQD.csv
"I hope I don't have to explain why password not required is bad. :)"

3. Accounts that have the password stored in a reversibly encrypted format
Get-ADUser -Filter 'useraccountcontrol -band 128' -Properties useraccountcontrol | export-csv U-ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PWD_ALLOWED.csv
"Because storing your password in reversible encryption is really bad."

4. List users that are trusted for Kerberos delegation
Get-ADUser -Filter 'useraccountcontrol -band 524288' -Properties useraccountcontrol | export-csv U-TRUSTED_FOR_DELEGATION.csv
"Because unconstrained Kerberos delegation means that random service account can make Kerberos tickets for EVERYONE! Yay!"

5. List accounts that don't require pre-authentication
Get-ADUser -Filter 'useraccountcontrol -band 4194304' -Properties useraccountcontrol | export-csv U-DONT_REQUIRE_PREAUTH.csv
"Pre auth puts your time stamp encrypted into the request to help against attacks."

6. List accounts that have credentials encrypted with DES
Get-ADUser -Filter 'useraccountcontrol -band 2097152' -Properties useraccountcontrol | export-csv U-USE_DES_KEY_ONLY.csv
"Because DES = plaintext essentially."
