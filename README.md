Windows PowerShell Scripts

This is a repository that houses useful PowerShell scripts. The scripts that are located here range from 
scripts that were created while I was a beginnger and automating simple tasks to scripts that I continue to 
create as I become more advanced. 

Use these scripts at your own risk and know what the script does before you run it (especially in a production
environment).

Thanks!
